# Chaste_Pixel
Library for drawing shapes one pixel at a time with optional delay.

I had previously created my own graphics library called BBM which could draw any arbitrary sequence of lines and polygons to image files which allowed me to create animations with one frame for each pixel drawn. However, after I discovered Raylib I thought about porting the library over to Raylib to make more of these animations.

This will also allow me to test things like flood fill algorithms in the future if I write them.
